# DivCl-Loc-GL-update

Writes out a plain text macro (.mac) for use in another system, with variables based on user input when the script is run.

This has a pretty specific use case, but I'm uploading it because includes some functions that I'll probably use elsewhere. It's also an early foray into using function calls for a majority of the program's execution.

I did change some values and edit some messages to try and anonymize this, so if future me needs to re-download this, he will need to go over it line by line to make sure those are changed back...
